# Hospital Mortality Rate SQL Analysis

**Aim of the project :** To study the mortality rate in hospitals, how do they correlate to factors such as age, ethnicity, comorbidities, gender, weight, and BMI

**Business Problem:** Health care professionals (HCPs) are trying to identify the reason why a patient succumbs to death while being admitted in a hospital. If they have a clear understanding of why they loose a patient, they will be able to reduce the mortality rate by implementing systematic interventions that treats the specific individual based on factors mentioned above. This will reduce the in-hospital mortality rate significantly

**Approach & Solution:** To begin adressing the business problem at hand, I started by importing the data to MS Excel, I cleaned it up and then studied the dataset carefully to get a big picture view. I then imported it to an SQL editor and proceeded with the analysis by writing queries that extracted meaningful insights from the data. The granularities mentioned about patients such as age, gender, ethnicity, BMI, weight, height, illnesses, heart rates among others played a key role in my analysis. Through these queries, various patterns and correlations emerged that could provide HCPs significant insights and aid them in reducing in-hospital deaths. Further, I imported the data in Tableau Public and created a dashboard to clearly help visualize the correlations that came to light as a part of my analysis.
